    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span>(/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7]
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and <span>multi-paradigm</span>. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
    The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
